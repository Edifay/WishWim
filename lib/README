Here are supposed to be the tree-sitter api and their parser.

In the folder '/lib', you can use 'git clone <link>', using the link of the parsers and the tree-sitter api.

 -> git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter.git
 -> git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c.git
 -> git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python.git

You may need to use make in each lib folder.
